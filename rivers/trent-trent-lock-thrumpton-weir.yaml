grade:
  text: 3/4
  value: 3.5
desc: 'A big green (brown) fast wave that you can front surf and carve around on to your hearts content. The shape of the waves favours longer (faster) boats.'
directions: 'The best parking spot (i.e. the one that causes least bother to locals) is the public car parks near the Trent Lock Inn. Once on the water, paddle downstream ~300m, avoid turning left onto the canal. Just after the railway bridge is the weir - itâ€™s possible to paddle past the bouys on the left. Getting back you have two choices - put in above the weir and paddle upstream, which can be a challenge in high flows / wind, or paddle downstream a few hundred meters and turn left to come back along the canal cut, portaging the lock.'
