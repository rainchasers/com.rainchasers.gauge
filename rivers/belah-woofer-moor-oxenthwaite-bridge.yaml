desc: 'In theory an excellent spate beck with continuous boulder rapids and a few big falls for good measure. Unfortunately, the amount of wood and fences spoils it somewhat meaning a lot of portages are currently required. '
directions: 'Take the road to Tan Hill from Brough via Barras. Park just after the forest where a track leads down into the woods by a small stone bridge. Follow the track a short way but before entering the wood head off down the hill following the wall across some boggy ground to join the river. Get out on the left bank just below Oxenthwaite Bridge.
