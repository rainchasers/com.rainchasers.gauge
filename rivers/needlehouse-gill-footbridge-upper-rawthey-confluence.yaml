desc: 'An alternative start to the Upper Rawthey. A 2.5m fall, a 7m slide and a tight difficult gorge that''s probably blocked with trees!'
directions: "From Rawthey Bridge carry on upstream and take a small road on the right. After 1km, turn right again, and then park where the road forks. Walk the boats down the left fork to a bridge over Needlehouse Gill and choose where's best to put on above this.\nThis would only be run if you intended carrying on down the Upper Rawthey.\n"
