desc: 'Wide meandering section with two weirs to be aware of. The first small weir is just after a railway bridge and washes out in high water but can be very grabby at certain levels. The second is a big drop onto a ledge. A definite portage. The route round both is on river right. You can take out here, or continue through Carlisle itself. '
directions: 'A small carpark, accessed from the middle of Dalston provides a convenient put-in. The takeout is just before the confluence with the Eden with a large car park behind the castle.'
