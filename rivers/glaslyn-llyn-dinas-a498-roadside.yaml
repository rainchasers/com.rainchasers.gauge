desc: 'Pleasant run with no nasties. Can be combined with the gorge below to provide interest for a mixed group of beginners and experts. Hardest section is about a mile above Beddgelert as the river passes under a bridge, you can stop and take a peek on the shuttle to confirm levels are OK.'
directions: 'Putin from any of a number of laybys off the A498 next to Llyn Dinas, a few miles north of Beddgelert. Takeout either in Beddgelert itself, or from another layby off the A498 about a mile south of Beddgelert before the gorge.'
