  value: 2
desc: 'Cruisy grade 2 run with no nasties that is good for introducing beginners to moving water.'
directions: 'Putin at the upstream outskirts of Brecon just above the weir. Takeout at the bridge on the minor road off the A40 heading towards Talybont-on-Usk. Parking is a bit tight as you have to just tuck the car into the roadside on the river-right side of the bridge. A stile leads into the field on upstream river-right from which you can access the river just above the bridge.'
