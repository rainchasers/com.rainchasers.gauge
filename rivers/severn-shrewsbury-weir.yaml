desc: 'Shrewsbury Weir is a playspot that comes into condition only when the Severn is very high. At lower levels it can form a dangerous stopper and should be avoided - note that the level suggested here is only an indicator that it should be running. If it looks nasty, it probably is - don''t get on! The wave flushes when the river rises further.   '
directions: 'The weir is just downstream of the town centre itself. There is ample parking along Sydney Avenue - just find somewhere the water won''t be start lapping at your car whilst you''re strutting your stuff. '
