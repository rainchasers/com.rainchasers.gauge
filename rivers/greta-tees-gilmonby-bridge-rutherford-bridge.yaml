  text: 2/3
  value: 2.5
desc: 'An extra few kms to add to the start of the Greta at a slightly easier grade to the rest. The weir above Rutherford Bridge can be dodgy in high water.'
directions: "Put-in from the footpath at Gilmonby Bridge, down the road from Bowes (easier to park in Bowes and walk down the hill). Walking a few hundred metres upstream will allow you to run Mill Force (3+) as a warm up.\nYou can take out at Rutherford Bridge, but would be better to continue on down the next section."
