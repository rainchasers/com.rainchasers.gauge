  value: 2.5
desc: 'A trib of the Swale, which runs in high water. Starts off as fast continuous grade 3 from Whaw in decent water, with few eddies. Mellows a bit in the middle, and gets shallow where the river splits into various channels. Steeps up a bit again as you approach Reeth. There''s one sheep fence to be aware of and trees are always going to be an issue, particuarly towards the end.'
directions: "If the water is high put in at the road bridge in Whaw where there's space for a couple of cars, otherwise use the road bridge above Langthwaite. In very high water it may be possible to put-in even higher up for added fast grade 3.\nTake out either in Reeth or in Grinton after the Swale confluence, or continue down the Swale."
