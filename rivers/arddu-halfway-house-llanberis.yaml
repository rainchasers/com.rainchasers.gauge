desc: 'An adventurous day out with a walkin to the putin. The drops tend to be grouped: a flurry of steeper drops, a breather, then another flurry. The section around the Snowdon railway bridge is grade 5+, and includes Llanberis Falls.'
directions: 'Head up a steep road beside Llanberis Snowdon railway station that runs near the track. Keep going as far as possible until continuing on foot.'
