  value: 3.5

desc: 'The harder rapids are all concentrated at the top of this rarely run river. To avoid the harder rapids and enjoy an alpine style (read steep and fast) grade 3 run, put in at the footbridge 1km downstream from the put-in.'
directions: 'Whilst the forestry-track to the put-in is physically drivable, the road is not open for public access so it is recommended to park in the large parking area just downstream of Blengdale Bridge and man-up for the walk-in. You''ll have driven past Wellington Bridge at the takeout on the way up the valley.'
