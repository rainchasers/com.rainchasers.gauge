  text: 2/3
  value: 2.5
desc: 'Often paddled in conjunction with the top section, this part of the river conveniently contains all the whitewater interest if you''re after a quick blast down a shorter section. The run starts with a small weir - beware the towback in high levels. The best section of this run is the final kilometre through the town, where the river yields a number of bouncy grade 3''s with nice surf waves at certain levels.'
directions: 'Parking is possible on river left above the roadbridge, adjacent to the weir. Take-out just after the confluence from the Derwent, river right just after the first bridge you pass under. There is a huge car park next to a play area where you can leave your car.'
