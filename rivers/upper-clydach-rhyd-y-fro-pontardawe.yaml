desc: 'An excellent spate stream: continuously hard paddling. Watch out for the grade 6 fall, just after a bridge: this has been run but only in big flood, most will portage river left. There is a boxed in weir just above Pontardawe which is sketchy in big flood, portage right if necessary. Takeout just above the tunnel in town.'
directions: 'Takeout in Pontardawe at the lower of the two A474 bridges: there is a carpark just upstream of the bridge on river right. Putin at the northern outskirts of Rhyd-y-fro: a small road (Barans Road) heads off the A474 and crosses the river at a bridge. Alternatively take the RH turn further up to a bridge over the Afon Egel. '
