  value: 3
desc: 'Combined with the section above is the classic Usk run. The ledge drop on the LH bend about 100m below the putin can be sticky, but other than this a no-nasties run, with good playholes in flood. Takeout on river right just below the weir under the bridge.'
directions: 'Putin at Llangynidr bridge or from the section above, accessing the river from river-left side of the bridge and parking up the hill on the outskirts of the village. Takeout at the A4077 bridge at Crickhowell: there is a convenient layby on river-right just upstream of the bridge itself.'
