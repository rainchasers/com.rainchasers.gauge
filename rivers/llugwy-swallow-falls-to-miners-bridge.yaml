desc: 'Swallows Falls can be paddled as a park-n-slide in low conditions, at higher levels you would normally getin underneath the main falls. These falls are usually sneaked down the river right channel, although it has been main-lined down the centre. A kilomtre or so of easier water follows until you reach another 500m of tough drops culminating at Miner''s bridge, a footbridge across the river. Either getout here or continue down a short stretch of easier water to Betws-y-Coed. If you do continue downstream, there is another tough drop behind the chip-shop in the middle of town.'
directions: 'Putin at Swallow Falls on the A5 just north of Betws-y-Coed: there is a large layby opposite the Swallow Falls Hotel. Takeout at Miner''s Bridge just at the outskirts of Betws-y-Coed or continue down into the town.'
