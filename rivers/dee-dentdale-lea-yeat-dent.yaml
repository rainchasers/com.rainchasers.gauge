desc: 'The first few kms act as a warm up to Ibbeth Peril Falls - a 3m slide into a large plunge pool. To the right of the fall is an undercut cliff containing Ibbeth Peril Cave - a pothole which you won''t want to be anywhere near! Below this are three more hard falls, all of which have now been paddled, but a portage of the middle one may be advisable. The river then eases off to grade 3, before becoming flat for the last few kms down to Dent.'
