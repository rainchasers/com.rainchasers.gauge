desc: 'Pleasant easy paddle until the stiff grade 5 gorge. This can be portaged, but is best inspected before getting on (from the road to Gaer-gerrig and the old A5). From here to the confluence is an excellent paddle with just a few weirs to keep an eye out for. The gnarly gorge is a good trip in it''s own right, although you''ve got to catch the water levels just right.'
directions: 'River runs alongside the A5 just west of Corwen. Takeout at Meardy, and putin at the first bridge west of Ty Nant.'
