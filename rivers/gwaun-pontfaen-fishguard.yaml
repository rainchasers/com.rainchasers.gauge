desc: 'A fun easy spate run. Don''t try to get on any higher than the recommended putin, upstream is filled with trees.'
directions: 'Takeout in the harbour at Fishguard. To reach the putin head up the Gwaun along the B4313 and putin at Pontfaen. Sometimes the upper half of the river can be a little tree choked: an alternative put-in is the bridge halfway down at Llanychaer.'
