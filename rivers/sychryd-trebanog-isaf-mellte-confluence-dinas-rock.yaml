  text: 4/5
  value: 4.5
desc: 'You get on just below a tunnel, and grade 2/3 water leads down to a 3m waterfall with a shallow landing. The best section is shortly downstream as you paddle under a wooden footbridge, and ends in a 10m gorge. As the river flatterns out and you paddle past a big cave on river right watch out for the boulder choke downstream. An awkward portage on river left that requires a rope.'
directions: 'Takeout at the confluence with the Mellte at a large carpark by a small stone bridge that you''ll reach driving east towards the river through Pontneddfechan. Putin at a layby off the A465, this is only accessible when travelling eastbound along the A465, just before it crosses the river.'
