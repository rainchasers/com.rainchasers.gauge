desc: 'The classic section of the Tawe: a great run.  The grade can vary from 3+ to 5 between low and spate levels. At high levels be careful of the huge walled in hole that forms just downstream of Pen y Cae bridge. After this are a series of slides before a fun waterfall. After a final gorge the river eases before the takeout in Abercraf.'
directions: 'Putin at the A4067 bridge at Glyntawe, and takeout somewhere in Abercraf: either at the upstream A4067 bridge, at the weir a few hundred metres downstream of this bridge (accessed via a small road down to the river near the large layby), or near the downstream A4067 bridge. '
