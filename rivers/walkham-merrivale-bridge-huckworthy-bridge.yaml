desc: 'Relentless choss with it''s fair share of branches thrown in to make sure it stays exciting. The first 500m is particularly tree ridden and it might be worth walking round.'
directions: 'At Merrivale there is a small bridge just upstream of the main road with good parking. The takeout has far less parking, so best to leave one car here and the rest at the top.'
