desc: "Small, steep trib of the Upper Swale with plenty of small drops, fences and a short walled-in gorge containing some siphons near the end. Finishes with Currack Force waterfall which has a very shallow landing in all but spate levels.\nThanks to Dave Peel for info."
directions: "In high water put-in at road bridge on Stonesdale Lane when driving towards Tan Hill. Also possible to put in from bridleway about 1km further down the valley with a short walk-in.\nEither take-out above Currack Force or carry on down the Swale where it merges just below Rainby Force (although easy to get out and run Rainby too)."
