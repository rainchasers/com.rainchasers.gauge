desc: 'A stunt in the middle of Ambleside! Two big falls at the start which have been run, but rarely cleanly. A series of slides and falls follow down into the town, before flattening out on to the Rothay.'
directions: 'Obvious if you''re in Ambleside, just follow the river up as a high as you want to go. Either take out in Ambleside, or continue onto the Rothay.'
