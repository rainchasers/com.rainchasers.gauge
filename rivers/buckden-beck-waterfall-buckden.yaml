desc: 'A short, steep mountain-surfing stunt if you''ve done everything else in upper Wharfedale and it''s still raining. Point downstream and hold on - that''s about it. Be sure to find the eddy below the long slide and take out.... there''s a fence just below.'
directions: 'From Buckden village, carry up the beck a couple of hundred yards to below the waterfall, putting on at the (too shallow) plungepool. '
