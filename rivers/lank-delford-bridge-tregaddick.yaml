  value: 5
desc: 'Masochistic. Mellow for the first 1.5km, then suddenly drops steeply through quarry workings. Watch out for the river disappearing underground: carry up river right past the quarry buildings to where it re-surfaces. This happens again later. Once you reach the footbridge (an alternative putin) you''ve braved the worst, and the river eases to grade 4.'
directions: 'Putin at Delford Bridge, the bridge downstream of the village of Bradford. Takeout at the bridge at Tregaddick just upstream of the confluence with the river Camel.'
