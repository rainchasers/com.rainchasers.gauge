desc: 'The full run from Ramsbottom contains a collection of weirs to shoot. The Burrs site itself has been developed for paddlers, with a collection of playable waves and stoppers. Careful of the big weir at the top of the Burrs site in high water. The stopper can become nasty.'
directions: 'The put-in from Ramsbottom is upstream of the main road bridge. The Burrs site itself can be used as a take-out, or a base to do laps.'
