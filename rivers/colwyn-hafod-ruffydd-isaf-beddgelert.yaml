desc: 'Fun high water run, continuous interest all the way down with regular tricky drops to provide spice.'
directions: 'Take out at the confluence with the Glaslyn in Beddgelert (or at the end of the Aberglasyn Gorge, which will be at a great level). To get to the putin head towards Carnarfeon from Beddgelert up the A4085. After 1.5 miles take a small left turn down towards the river and follow it to a small bridge over the river. Be subtle and leave as few vehicles here as possible as there is a farm right next to this bridge.'
