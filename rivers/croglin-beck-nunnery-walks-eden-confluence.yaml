desc: 'A series of four waterfalls. The first is a big 10m straight drop into a big plunge pool. The second is a twisty double drop consisting of two 1.5/2m falls. The third is 4m and should only be run in high water. The last drop is a simple river wide 1.5m high ledge. The beck then levels out until you join the Eden.'
directions: 'Either walk up the side of the beck as part of an Eden trip or find the beck next to Nunnery Walks in Staffield.'
