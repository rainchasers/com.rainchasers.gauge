desc: 'A fun river, with a superb gorge section. In high water an absolute blast!'
directions: 'Takeout at the main A4069 road bridge just south of Llangadog, or the smaller bridge 1.5km downstream. It helps if you have an OS map to find the put-in at the small bridge between Llwynfron and Twynllanan. Alternatively, for a less tree infested put-in, start your trip at Pont Aber on the A4069 for the last 1 km of the Clydach before it joins the Sawdde.'
