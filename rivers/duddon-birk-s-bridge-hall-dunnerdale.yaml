desc: 'An absolute classic. At the put-in is the gun-barrel run (gd5) - 100m of narrow siphon-filled mank for the brave. 500m of gd3 leads into Troutal gorge (gd5): portage river left. Fun, continuous grade 3 water leads down to Wallowbarrow gorge (continuous gd4+/5), inspect along the footpath on river right. The river then eases off for the last 2km down to Hall Bridge.'
directions: 'Takeout at Hall Dunnerdale Bridge to the north of Broughton in Furness. To reach the putin head upstream to a picnic site by the river at Birks bridge (a disused bridge just off the road).'
