desc: 'An interesting diversion from the Duddon. A hard slide/slot at the put-in leads into a continuous gorge section and a final rocky fall, before levelling out as the beck joins the main river. A good giggle.'
directions: 'As you drive through Seathwaite up the valley you''ll see Tarn beck on your left. Park up next to the stone wall and put on as high as the water level/value of your boat allows. Take out after the final fall by the footbridge, or combine with a run of the lower Duddon.'
