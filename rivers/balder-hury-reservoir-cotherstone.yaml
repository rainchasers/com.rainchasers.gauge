  value: 3
desc: 'Tree infested spate trib of the Tees, with one harder fall. Difficult to predict water levels due to relying on the Hury dam to release, but generally only goes after heavy rain.'
directions: "Drive up to Hury Reservoir and put on below the dam. Obviously do not attempt to paddle down the dam overspill, which in no way resembles a big kayak slide.\nGet out at the confluence with the Tees in Cotherstone, where there's convenient parking down a small track signposted \"to the river.\""
