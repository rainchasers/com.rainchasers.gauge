desc: 'Fun bouncy run. The harder drop is about halfway down as the banks close in. Watch out for fences.'
directions: 'Takeout at the small bridge in Heolyrhedyn (just north of Ystradfellte) at the confluence with the Llia. To reach the putin head south up a steep hill and take a small road on the left upstream. Head up here for a few km and then park and walk down to the river.'
