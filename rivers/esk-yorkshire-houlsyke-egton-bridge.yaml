km: 10
grade:
  text: '3'
  value: 3
desc: 'An expedition into the Yorkshire Moors in heavy rain may result in finding this river up. It consists of three gorges running at grade 3 (possibly 4 in high levels) connected by flat water. '
directions: 'It is possible to put in at Castleton, but this only adds another 10km of arduous flat water. The normal put-in is therefore a mile or two above Lealholm, under a railway bridge and along a footpath across a field. Parking here is difficult, we dropped the boats and parked in a layby a few hundred metres further up the road on the left. Get out river right at Egton Bridge.'
