desc: 'The rapid under the bridge in Llandovery can reach grade 3 in high water, but otherwise a relaxed and pleasant grade 2 touring run.'
directions: 'Putin at Dolauhirion, the minor road bridge just upstream of the main A40 bridge in Llandovery. Takeout at the bridge downstream of the Llandeilo A483 bridge, on a minor road between Llangathen and Golden Grove. It is possible to takeout in Llandeilo to shorten the run by 5km, but access to the river is tricky.'
