desc: 'A good run, with an excellent gorge between nasty weirs. Watch out for Abercraf weir on a left-hand bend not far from the putin: it needs to be portaged early on river right. It can be inspecting by walking through the children''s playground in the village. A great gorge follows before a double weir under a bridge just downstream of Ystradgynlais and the confluence with the Giedd. This can be difficult to stop above and so may be worth inspecting before you putin. A few easier weirs lead down the takeout on river right at the Twrch confluence.'
directions: 'Putin along a footpath on river left at the upstream A4067 bridge in Abercraf. Takeout on river right at the confluence with the Twrch (between Ystragynlais and Ystalyfera).'
