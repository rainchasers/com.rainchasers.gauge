desc: 'Enjoyable bimble through pleasant countryside, beware of the occasional tree. The whitewater interest lies in the second half of the run where a few rapids liven up the approach to Calder Bridge. It is possible to continue past Calder Bridge, taking in some unusual sandstone gorges. Possible takeouts are a) at a public footpath which goes down to the river, or b) continuing through the Sellafield nuclear site down to the sea. Note that there are a couple of grade 4 rapids through Sellafield which are made all the more interesting by their unique location.'
directions: 'Thornholme Farm can be reached from Calder Bridge by turning off the Cold Fell road as it zig-zags up a steep hill. There isn''t much parking, but make sure to leave access for farm traffic. There is a large car park on your left as the Cold Fell road enters Calder Bridge.'
