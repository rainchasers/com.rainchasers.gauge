river: Tawe
section: 'Upper Tawe Gorge'
km: 6
grade:
  text: '5'
  value: 5
desc: 'Decent water leads down into the gorge with a 5m waterfall shortly after the entrance. Plenty more excellent drops follow, but watch out for trees. The river eases off to grade 3/4 as the banks open out, and you pass the Tywynni confluence before taking out river right just above the bridge at Glyntawe or carrying on downstream straight onto the next section.'
directions: 'Takeout at the A4067 bridge at Glyntawe (or better, paddle the section downstream). To reach the putin turn off the A4067 along a minor road up river left just north of Glyntawe and continue for a few km until the road comes close to the river.'
