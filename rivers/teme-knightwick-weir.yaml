desc: 'Small green wave at normal base levels, perfect for introducing beginners to moving water; the wave improves as the levels rise becoming increasingly fast and green up to about 0.8 - 0.9 when it closes out - use your own judgement whether to paddle or not. As the river continues to rise the wave greens out again before finally washing out above about 1.35m'
directions: 'The weir is just downstream of Knightsford bridge, just east of Knightswick on the A44. Park in the lay-by on the river left and walk down to the weir.'
