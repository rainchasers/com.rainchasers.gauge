desc: 'A good introduction to whitewater for beginners or as a touring run: lots of small natural rapids and a few weirs. Bolham weir at the takeout is nasty: portage around on river right and then paddle across the river downstream of the weir to takeout by the road on river left. '
directions: 'Putin at Bridgetown, or you could shorten the trip by putting in at Exebridge. Takeout at Bolham weir, about 2km north of Tiverton along the A386.'
