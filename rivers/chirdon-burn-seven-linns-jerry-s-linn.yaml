desc: 'Obscure spate ditch in Kielder Forest. The Seven Linns section is a series of falls and slides. Other notable features are Cat Linns and Jerry''s Linn (a 4m fall).'
directions: 'You need to get the OS map out and get familiar with forestry tracks! The Seven Linns, which are a few hundred metres long are the main event and it''s debatable as to whether it''s worth paddling the rest of the beck, or just going to Jerry''s Linn for a one-hit wonder.'
