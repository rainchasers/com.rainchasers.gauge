desc: 'Unusual and undemanding run: mediocre whitewater but fun as an exploratory adventure. First 500m often portaged along the footpath river left to avoid 2 sheep fences, before continuous gd2 through open moorland. Landacre bridge is an alternative takeout as it is flat from there down to Withypool.'
directions: 'Putin at the small bridge in Simonsbath, and takeout at the main bridge in Withypool. Lanacre bridge bridge is a possible alternative takeout (a few km upstream of Withypool) as it is flat from here down.'
