desc: 'Artle Beck starts with a bang - a cheeky drop immediately after the put-in. The river then makes its way into a steep sided gorge with more fun grade 3 rapids. Beware of trees throughout and a deer fence just above Gresgarth Hall. Just next to the hall is the biggest drop on the river - a large bowl shaped weir.'
directions: 'From Caton, head eastwards towards Brookhouse and turn left up the hill. Follow the road all the way to Crossgill, parking just over the far side of the bridge in a convenient bay, big enough to hold 3 or 4 cars.'
