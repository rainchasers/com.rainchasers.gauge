  value: 5
  max: 6
desc: 'A serious undertaking.'
directions: 'Takeout at the confluence with the Teigl where there is a footpath out to the road. Head upstream along the A496 and get on at a small bridge off the main road as soon as it comes back to the river. If you head up higher than this there is a really nasty drop under the next bridge upstream.'
