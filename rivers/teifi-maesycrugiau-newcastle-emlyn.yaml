desc: 'A relaxed run with occasional grade 2/3 rapids. Watch out for a weir at the bridge just upstream of Llangeler, it can be nasty at high levels. 3km below this weir is the hardest drop, the grade 3+ Henllan Falls.'
directions: 'Putin just above or below the grade 3 drop at the bridge in Maesycrygiau, along minor roads just north-west of Llanllwni. Takeout on river right at the carpark by the rugby ground in Newcastle Emlyn, just upstream of the main bridge along the A475.'
