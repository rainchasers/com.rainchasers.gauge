desc: 'Great run: steep slabs at the start, plenty of grade 3 and then a straightforward but bigger fall towards the end. Beware of this one in bigger levels as there aren''t many eddies above it!'
directions: 'Takeout at Mealbank bridge, on the B6480 just north of Wray. Putin at the bridge near Lowgill village: go across the first bridge across the Hindburn and 100m later is another bridge over a small side beck at a sharp bend: from here there is access down to the confluence.'
