desc: 'A classic introduction to whitewater with Hack Falls and Slenningford Rapids being the highlights. Care should be taken at a number of weirs, in particular Tanfield wier just before Slenningford Rapids'
directions: 'There are several options for the put-in: the most hassle-free is to park at the public car park above Hack Falls and access via the public footpath; Mickley village if you want to avoid Hack Falls; or from Masham for a longer run. Takeout at Slenningford Water Mill, which has a shop, toilets and changing area and may require payment for use of the facilities.'
