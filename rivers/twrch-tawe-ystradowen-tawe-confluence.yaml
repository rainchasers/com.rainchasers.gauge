desc: 'Fast and bouncy in big water; lots of weirs. At lost levels, all the weirs are runnable, the biggest being a sloping weir directly under the bridge in Ystalyfera. This is a possible takeout, or continue downstream to the Tawe confluence.'
directions: 'Putin in Ystradowen at a bridge down a small road off the A4068 just south of Cwmllynfell. Takeout in Ystalyfera, either at the bridge with the large weir underneath, or further downstream at the confluence with the Tawe.'
