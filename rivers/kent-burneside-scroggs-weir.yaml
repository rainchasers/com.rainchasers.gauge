desc: 'One weir in Kendal to be aware of in high flows, the remainder is a fun float through Kendal and a nice way to make a full day out of a trip down the Sprint, Mint or upper Kent by linking it with the lower Kent.'
directions: 'Downstream of the bridge (river right) in Burneside is a small park and area for parking; an ideal put-in spot. Traverse Kendal, and just as you leave the residential area heading south on the A6, a small road turns off from a lay-by on the left. Drive right down to the end and there''s a fairly sizeable parking area next to the river.'
