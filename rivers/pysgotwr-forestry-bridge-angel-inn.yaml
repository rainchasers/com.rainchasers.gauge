desc: 'At suitable levels for the gorge the first 3km will be a flat scrape. The gorge itself is tough, and much probably still hasn''t been paddled. A km above the Doethie confluence the river eases back to gd3/4 before the takeout at Junction Pool (Towy confluence).'
directions: 'Takeout at "junction pool" at the confluence with the Tywi between Ystradffin and Rhandirmwyn. An OS map would be useful to find the putin via small roads from Llanddewi Brefi.'
