desc: 'The top section is fast but tree-infested, but soon turns into a pleasant touring paddle. Watch out for a 8m waterfall about 5km down just below a small bridge over the river (inspect from the footpath on river left).'
directions: 'Takeout at the main road bridge in Pontardulais, just before the confluence with the Gwili. Putin at the bridge about a km upstream of Dre-fach. The top section can be tree-infested and there are a number of small bridges further downstream if you want to shorten the trip.'
