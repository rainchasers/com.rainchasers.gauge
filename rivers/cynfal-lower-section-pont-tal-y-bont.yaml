desc: 'First up is a constriction finishing into a boxed in weir. Can scout right/portage right if its low enough. 50m later is a clean 20ft drop which is hard to scout, best taken middle or left. Second 20fter take on river right as there is a tree on river left. Still a clean line. The final 500m is grade 2/3 through a jungle of trees. Has been done without portages - but good luck!'
directions: 'Walk up from the bottom on river left. There should be a trail leading down into the gorge at the second style/gate. Get on after the tree choke. '
