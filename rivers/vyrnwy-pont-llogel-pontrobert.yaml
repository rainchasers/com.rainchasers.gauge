desc: 'The best of the Vyrnwy. Pleasant grade 2/3 down to the bridge at Dolanog is shortly followed by a nasty weir. Below, the walls close in as you enter the fun grade 3/4 (depending on levels) Dolanog gorge. Inspect as necessary from the footpath on river right. Easier water leads down to the takeout at Pontrobert.'
directions: 'Putin at the B4395 bridge at Llogel, or paddle the section above down from the dam itself. Takeout in Pontrobert on river left 50m upstream of the bridge through a stile out to the road.'
