desc: 'A fun run whose difficultly depends very much on the levels. Starting with 2km of grade 3/4 the run hots up after reaching a 1.5m horseshoe weir. Downstream is hard grade 4 and two grade 5 falls. The 2nd grade 5 is about 50m above the takeout bridge, and it is easy to walk up and have a quick look-see before you get on.'
directions: 'Takeout at the B4403 bridge in Llanuwchllyn, at the SW end of Llyn Tegid near Bala. To reach the put-in head upstream along a steep road on river right to Talardd and get-on at the the bridge.'
