desc: 'Fun grade 2 run, with a harder grade 3 section at the end as you approach the Usk confluence. Watch out for a sloping weir under a bridge halfway down the run.'
directions: 'Takeout at the Usk in Sennybridge: take the turning into the Army barracks and then head down a small road just to the right of the barracks next to the river. The hardest rapid is at the confluence with the Usk: it is difficult to scout from the river so worth taking a look from the A40 road bridge before you get on. To reach the putin head south along the A4215 and then take a minor road through Cefnfedw to a bridge at Heol Senni.'
