desc: '2km of easier water leads down to the highlight: Alpine bridge gorge and the following km of gd2/3. Below here the river is flatter with occasional gd1/2 rapids. Takeout just before the Wye confluence at the obvious old railway bridge on river right. A 5min walk from here takes you to a small road.'
directions: 'Putin at Shakey bridge, a small footbridge next to the road directly east of Llandrindod Wells, it can be tricky to find so an OS map is helpful. Takeout at the small road on river right at the Wye confluence, it is possible to walk down to the river from the road.'
