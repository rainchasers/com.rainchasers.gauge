desc: "A tidal playboating spot at a line of rocks that jut out into Ramsey Sound between Ramsey Island and the mainland. It is best to go out about 3hrs before high water and warm-up on the increasing flow of the tide.\n\nTwo main spots exist. A hole, closer to the island, and the \"main wave\" further out. Have a look for the queues of boaters if you're unsure!"
directions: 'Paddle southwards from St Justinians, starting at the steps by the Lifeboat Station, up the giant eddy formed by the Pen Dal-Aderyn headland. Once you can''t get any further, start the ferry across Ramsey Sound to The Bitches. Play ''till your hearts content, then make the mother of all ferry''s back to the lifeboat station. Note that Horse Rock, right in the middle of this ferry can produce dangerous currents. Either cut above  it, or drop below. If in doubt seek local advice.'
