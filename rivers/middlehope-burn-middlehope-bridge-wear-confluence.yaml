desc: 'The old mine workings is where the fun bit starts and isn''t a bad walk down an obvious track - park by the stile at the top of the hill on the little road up from Westgate.The highlight of the run is a tunnel to boof to tunnel combo in the middle of the old mine workings, and carries on down into the wooded gorge below. This is very pleasant grade 3 with regular small ledge drops to keep up the interest. A bit tree-ey at the moment though, but the interest will continue all the way down to Westgate. '
