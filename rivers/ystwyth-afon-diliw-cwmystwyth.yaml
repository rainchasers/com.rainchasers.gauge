desc: 'A spate run down the Diliw into the Ystwyth, full of boulder gardens and boulder-choked drops.'
directions: 'Takeout at the bridge in Cwmystwyth. To reach the putin on tarmac you''ll need to loop round through Llangurig and head down a small road off the A44 through Glangwy. Much shorter is to head directly upstream from Cwmystwyth and then take a rough track up the Diliw at Blaenycwm (this would be tough without a 4x4). It is also possible to putin on the upper Ystwyth by by continuing upstream along the road from Blaenycwm, or just putin at the Diliw confluence and avoid all the faff!'
