desc: 'Flat sections interspersed by grade 2/3 rapids - enough of a gap to pick up the pieces if it all goes to pot. A great first taste of whitewater. Armathwaite weir is easily portageable on river left if needs be.'
directions: 'A large car-park on river left just upstream of the bridge at Lazonby provides an ideal put-in, with steps down to the river. Takeout river right just below the bridge at Armathwaite.'
