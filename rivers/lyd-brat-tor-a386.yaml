desc: 'Scrappy but fun. Be careful at the takeout, egress well above the A386 bridge on river right: otherwise you get drawn into the tunnel under the road, and downstream is the unpaddleable Lydford gorge.'
directions: 'Takeout at the A386 bridge north of Tavistock. To reach the putin take the track off the A386 between the Dartmoor Inn and the petrol station up to the river.'
