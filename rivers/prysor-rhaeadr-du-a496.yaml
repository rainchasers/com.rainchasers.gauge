desc: 'A tough but awesome run. The gorge above the marked putin is extremely tricky and almost never has water in. The normal putin at Rhaeadr Du waterfall requires a walkin, from here down to the road bridge is demanding gd5.'
directions: 'Takeout at the A486 road bridge near Maentwrog Power Station. Head up the small road along river right and walkin to Rhaeadr Du along the track down from Gellilydan.'
