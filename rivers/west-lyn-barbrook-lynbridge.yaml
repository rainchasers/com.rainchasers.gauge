desc: 'Fun gd3/4 run. Watch out for a footbridge after the caravan park, this is the takeout. Get out above the bridge on river right and carry up to a pub carpark. Downstream is steep scary stuff, best avoided.'
directions: 'Putin at Barbrook, clambering down to the canalised river. Takeout at Lynbridge, a footbridge near a pub about a km downstream. Below this the river becomes heinous.'
