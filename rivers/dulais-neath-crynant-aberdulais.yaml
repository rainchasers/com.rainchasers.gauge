desc: 'Unremarkable grade 3 run. The hardest rapid is after an old railway bridge: a long steep grade 4. Takeout on river left before reaching Aberdulais Falls which would be a definite portage.'
directions: 'Takeout near the A4109 bridge in Aberdulais (just off the main A465). From the bridge head a little way upstream up river left through a housing estate to find somewhere where you can access the river. To reach the putin head upstream along the A4109 and take a small turnoff to a bridge just north of Crynant.'
